                <h1>About the Game</h1>
                <p>This project is the final version of a semester long project for COMP 424 Client-Side Web Design at Loyola University Chicago. For this project we had to make a client-side website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>Lucky Duck is based upon a joke about ducks between the two developers. The idea then morphed into a virtual version of the 'Lucky Duck' carnival game where players cast magnetic fishing rods into a pond of moving rubberducks. If a player is able to catch a duck they will get the prize promised on the bottom of the rubber duck. The original virtual version would have allowed users to cast their rod to catch a moving duck to earn points towards a high-score goal.</p>
                <p>Throughout the design process gameplay had many different versions such as carnival-style mini-games, catching ducks against a count down clock, earning coins to gain power-ups or better fishing rods. Ultimately the designers decided to simplify the game in favor of creating their own game engine. The game engine is based-off of <i>Build Your Own 2D Game Engine and Create Great Web Games: Using HTML5, JavaScript, and WebGL</i> by Kelvin Sung, Jebediah Pavleas, Jason Pace, and Fernando Arnez. The current version of the game has the user feeding bread to randomly placed ducks.</p>
